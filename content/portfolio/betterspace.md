## Learning management system
Developed as a team in my Information Systems class (CS 448) at Purdue University. Our goal was to deliver a solution for students to manage their classes, see upcoming assignments, get detailed information on their grades. On the other hand, we wanted professors to have complete control on their class(es). In our application, professors are able to create/remove classes, admit students into their class(es), report grades, sort grades to obtain useful stats (e.g. grade average).

## Frontend
To build the frontend, we decided to use React for a more responsive user interface (UI). However, for this application the focus was the backend and the interactions between our server and our DBMS (MongoDB Cloud).

## Backend
I directed backend development and managed our APIs. For our DBMS, I chose MongoDB Cloud, a NoSQL document-based database. Having worked with MongoDB in the past, I felt quite comfortable with the database design part of our application.
